topic-main-subtitle-1=[item=algae-farm] Algae farming
topic-main-description-1=Different Algae live off a variety of liquid solutions and growth enhancers, they then can be processed for the element they metabolized while growing.\n\n - [item=algae-green]Algae Green live off [fluid=water-mineralized]Mineralized Water and produces [item=cellulose-fiber]fibers which can replace some aspects of [item=wood]Wood.\n - [item=algae-brown]Algae Brown live off [fluid=water-saline]Saline Water and produces [item=solid-salt]Salts and [item=solid-alginic-acid]acid that can be combined with the [item=cellulose-fiber]fibers to produce [item=solid-paper]Paper.\n - [item=algae-blue]Algae Blue live off [fluid=water-yellow-waste]Sulfuric Waste Water and [fluid=gas-carbon-dioxide]Carbon Dioxide. They produce Nitrogen heavy compounds.\n - [item=algae-red]Algae Red live off [fluid=thermal-water]Thermal Water and [fluid=gas-ammonia]Ammonia. They produce Silicate heavy compounds.
topic-main-subtitle-2=[item=bio-arboretum-1] Arboretum
topic-main-description-2=By exploring the planet you find different types of deciduous tree in addition to the coniferous trees of the base game.\nExtract seeds out of these trees and start growing your own trees as a renewable source of [item=wood]Wood.\nMore advanced processing leads to more advanced tree growth, allowing you to extract [item=solid-resin]Resin, [item=plastic-bar]Plastic and [item=solid-rubber]Rubber out of these special trees.

topic-vegetablis-title=[item=seed-extractor] Vegetables Processing
topic-vegetablis-description=By exploring the planet you find gardens that you can investigate and refine to seeds. These seeds allow you to grow plants yourself. Process these plants for nutrients, fuel and oils.
